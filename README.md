# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
----
This is a Udacity project aimming at generating code that can recognize and classify traffic signs based on neural 
network and machine learning. The code is capable of taking in images of traffic signs and returns the class with highest probability.


## Model structure
The model mainly applied a LeNet-5 nerual network with dropout layer. More detail can be found in the code and writeup.md.

## Model performance
The code was trained and validated by a standard German traffic sign data set splitted into training and validation set. It reached
 a result of 99.7% training set accuracy, 94.8% validation set accuracy and 93.6% of testing set accuracy.
